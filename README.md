# GR-55 Patches and Tones

These are 2 JSON files of preset patches and tones from the Roland GR-55 PDF manual. The files were created with Anthropic Claude so there's a possibility of hallucination, but from spot checking they look like they're good. There's also a CSV file of the tone list if that format is preferable. Use at your own risk.
